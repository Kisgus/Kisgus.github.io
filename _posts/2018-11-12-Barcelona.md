In this post I will cover the evolution of a recent publication I co-authored on mutual-credit permissionless community currencies.


## The beginning

Back in 2017 I submitted a conference paper, and attended the [4th International Conference on Social and Complementary](https://ijccr.net/2016/08/27/iv-international-conference-on-social-and-complementary-currencies-10-14-may-2017/) taking place in Barcelona. The conference was organized by Research Assosication on Monetary Innovation and Commplementary Currency Systems aka [RAMICS](https://ramics.org/barcelona2017/) and featued several hundred researchers and practitioners working on social community, complementary and socail currencies all around the world.
