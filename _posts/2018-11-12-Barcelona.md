**In this post I will cover the evolution of a recent community currency publication I co-authored on permissionless mutual-credit community currencies.**


## Conference paper

Back in 2017 I submitted a conference paper, and attended the [4th International Conference on Social and Complementary](https://ijccr.net/2016/08/27/iv-international-conference-on-social-and-complementary-currencies-10-14-may-2017/) taking place in Barcelona. The conference was organized by Research Assosication on Monetary Innovation and Commplementary Currency Systems aka [RAMICS](https://ramics.org/barcelona2017/) and featued several hundred researchers and practitioners working on social community, complementary and socail currencies all around the world.

## Research objectives

Utilizing a design science approach our research objectives of the paper was to:

- Create a future value type of community currency, which allows the participants to exercise governance
rules while offering accountability by being based on a bilateral dispersive money creation process.
- Utilize the properties of blockchain technology in order to provide a freely accessible medium of exchange,
which can be used for community exchange in a secure, transparent and cross-community interoperable
manner.

### Past, Present & Future Money

Our choice of choosing mutual-credit currencies, was based on the below assumptions that money act as an accesible medium of exchange, based on the pros/cons of past, present and future types of money.

### Summary of the Trustlines Prototype 


The proposed prototype is named [Trustlines Network](trustlines.netwokr). It is a decentralised, permissionless, open source blockchain protocol to host multiple mutual-credit currency networks. In these currency networks, money is represented as bilateral obligations issued in form of "credit lines" between people that trust each other. The proposed Trustlines prototype
allows everyone with a smartphone to send payments to other participants - even to those that they don’t
know or trust. In that way, the system resembles the decentralised issuance of IOU’s taking place in Local Exchange
Systems [(LETS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system). Where LETS are built on the mutual-credit principle, Trustlines is an interconnected network of multiple LETS. People can only be liable up to the amount they decided to entrust in direct connections to other people. The enforceability of IOU claims is therefore informal and up to the two participants that set up a Trustline between each other.
