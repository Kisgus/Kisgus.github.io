**In this post I will cover the evolution of a recent publication I co-authored on permissionless mutual-credit community currencies.**


## The beginning

Back in 2017 I submitted a conference paper, and attended the [4th International Conference on Social and Complementary](https://ijccr.net/2016/08/27/iv-international-conference-on-social-and-complementary-currencies-10-14-may-2017/) taking place in Barcelona. The conference was organized by Research Assosication on Monetary Innovation and Commplementary Currency Systems aka [RAMICS](https://ramics.org/barcelona2017/) and featued several hundred researchers and practitioners working on social community, complementary and socail currencies all around the world.

## The journal article

Utilizing a design science approach our research objectives of the paper was to:

- Create a future value type of community currency, which allows the participants to exercise governance
rules while offering accountability by being based on a bilateral dispersive money creation process.
- Utilize the properties of blockchain technology in order to provide a freely accessible medium of exchange,
which can be used for community exchange in a secure, transparent and cross-community interoperable
manner.

The full paper can be downloaded free from the International Journal of Community Currency Research (IJCCR) [here.pdf](https://ijccr.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/71-84-ijccr-2018-summer-friis-glaser1.pdf)


### Past, Present & Future Money

Our choice of choosing mutual-credit currencies, was based on the below assumptions that money act as an accesible medium of exchange, based on its  about pros/cons of different types of money
