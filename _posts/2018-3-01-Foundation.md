title: Liquid Democracy: The Foundation
---


## Demoracy and Constituonalism

### Democracy

The concept of democracy is derived from the Greek words demos (people) and kratos (rule),
and thus means parliamentary rule (Held 2006: 1). This implies that political power is placed
with all the people in a democracy, unlike the other two classical rulings monarchy (arbitration) and aristocracy,
where power is placed by one person or few, respectively (Hansen 2017: 32). Since ancient Greece there have been many
perceptions of what the people's government actually implies, with different interpretations of, among other things, 
how the people should rule what the people are going to rule and who is the people (Held 2006: 1f).


### Constitutionalism

The Representative Democracy is commonly closely linked to the concept of constitutionalism, which implies that a written constitution
or constitution guarded by the courts can counter hasty democratic decisions that either violate individual freedoms 
or result in rapid and perhaps unthinkable radical changes in legislation ( Hansen 2010: 59f). 
The essence of constitutionalism is therefore described by economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek as:

``"... a limitation of the means available to a temporary majority for the achievement of particular objectives by general
 principles laid down by another majority for a long period in advance" (Hayek 1960: 180).``

## Liquid Democracy

### Origin and evolvement

The basic idea of the Liquid Democract can be traced back to 1884, where Charles Dodgson published the book
Principles of Parliamentary Representation, which included proposed a more dynamic form of Representative Democracy, where it was possible to delegate its voices to several different representatives (Ramos 2015: 179). 85 years later, Miller (1969) took up the idea of ​​his article A Program for Direct and Proxy Voting in the Legislative Process, which, in the light of recent technological advances, predicted a near future where it is possible for the population to vote from their own home computer, and therefore should be able to vote directly in political questions or delegate their voice further (Miller 1969: 107). Only 30 years later, however, there is an interest in these new democratic governance.
 It starts on the internet, where two blog posts from Sayke (2002) and Ford (2002), receive great attention. 
Ford develops a coherent democracy model, which he calls for delegative democracy,
 and describes his vision of an electronic delegation democracy that allows for area-specific delegation, 
but the concept of delegative democracy never really hits.

### Delegates

### Compensation

### Parties & Organisations

### Seperation of power

### Creation of new laws

## Voting Mechanisms

On the other hand, one must be able to make complex collective decisions, and therefore both Lönnfelt and Sigvald (2014: 113ff) and 
Green-Armytage (2015: 204f) propose that new voting methods be developed for the FD, which is both practical and democratic.
At the same time, there will be a number of general rules and procedures that reduce the possibility of so-called strategic
voting and other conscious use of the electoral system. Therefore, Behrens Mfl. And Green-Armytage (2015: 204f) suggest using 
preference polls when voters should relate to more than two alternatives because strategic voting will otherwise determine 
the final poll results.

### Instant withdrawl

### Continuous voting

### Median voting
