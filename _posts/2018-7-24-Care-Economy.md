## The Caux Palace

This May I participated at the kick-off workshop of the Care Economy together with interesting people from all over the world. The workshop took place in a wonderfull setting at the [Caux Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caux_Palace_Hotel), in the small mountain city Caux, near the Geneva Lake in Schwitzerland. Before going there I was stunned by the magnificent pictures of the Caux Palace. Before going there I talked to my mother, and she was quite skeptical why an alledgly highly humanitarian and alturistic conference would be hosted at such
a financial non-inclusive and remote place?

I eventually found out the Caux Palace was runned by the **initiative for change** foundation, and that this place had served as a very historic location for peace making for almost a century. I also discovered participants from remote places had their costs covered by [Mustardseed Trust](http://www.mustardseedtrust.org/belas-salon/). 

## Towards a Manifest

If one might assosciate the concept of the **Sharing Economy** with big multi-sided platforms such as Facebook, Uber & Airbnb allowing competetive p2p marketpalces via centralized intermediaries the **Caring Economy** is supposed to represent the opposite. The manifest of the Care Economy can as of now be summarized as:


The far vision is that all of humanity work together.
 
1.          We know know we must not till the earth. The soil can become ever more fertile and yield abundantly if we start to use our current agricultural understandings world wide.
2.          We now know we must store and use the massive amounts of energy the sun gives us each day. We now know how to do this.
3.          We know we must have a money system that is a currency and not a store of value, that flows abundantly to enable us produce and use what is needed to restore our earth.
4.          We know that we must change from our current domination culture to a collaborative partnership culture that is true to our fundamental nature. We must find our way out of the domination culture that we have allowed to enslave us all.
 
These things require a change in heart, from fear of scarcity to caring. They require that the millions of change makers world-wide work together to evolve us from an economy of ‘growth’ to an economy of care. We have set up [Mustardseed Trust](http://www.mustardseedtrust.org/belas-salon/) to do what it can to help to enable these changes to happen.
