## The European Blockchain Summer School 2016

My hands-on involvement with Ethereum was kickstarted at 1st edition of the European Blockchain Summer School taking place in Copenhagen the summer of 2016. The objective of this summerschool was to solve real-live problems fased by Maersk, Nordea & the Danish Tax Authorities within supply-chain, finance and public sector services. Attendees at the Summer School was for the most part PhD students from Europe. Through my contribtuion to the Ethereum Copenhagen Meetup I was lucky to take part even though I had not even finished my master studies at that point.


## Our collaboration with the Danish Tax Authorities

Throughout the Summer School I was with a few other students working with 4 representatives of the Danish Tax Authorities, to find a way to solve how their process of refunding dividend tax worked. At that point in time it had become a public news scandale that Denmark had paid out roughly 2 billion Euro to fraudelent actors which had not at all been entitled to a tax refund.
