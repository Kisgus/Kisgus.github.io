## The European Blockchain Summer School 2016

My first hands-on experience with Ethereum was kickstarted at the 1st edition of the European Blockchain Summer School in Copenhagen the summer of 2016. The objective of this summerschool was to solve real-live problems fased by Maersk, Nordea & the Danish Tax Authorities within supply-chain, finance and public sector services. Attendees at the Summer School was for the most part PhD students from Europe. Through my involvement with the Ethereum Copenhagen Meetup I was lucky to take part even though I had not finished my master studies at that point in time.


## Our collaboration with the Danish Tax Authorities

Throughout the Summer School I was with a few other students working with 4 representatives of the Danish Tax Authorities, to find a way to solve how their process of refunding dividend tax worked. At that point in time it had become a public news scandale that Denmark alone had paid out roughly 2 billion Euro to fraudelent actors which had not at all been entitled to a tax refund. Several other countries had as well been victims for the same scam in even greater amounts.
